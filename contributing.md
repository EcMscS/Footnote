# Contributing
Please note that we have a code of conduct that must be followed at all times. 

## Pull Request Process
1. When contributing to this repository, first ensure that there is an issue open with the changes you wish to make. If not, open an issue, and discuss the change with the repository maintainer. Every PR must have an associated issue. 
2. Please refrain from submitting a pull request for issues that have not been assigned to you. This is to ensure that beginners have an equal chance to contribute, in the spirit of Hacktoberfest. Issues with the good-first-issue label will be reserved for developers who are new to Swift, OSS, or development in general. 
3. You may merge the pull request once it has been reviewed by a project maintainer.
