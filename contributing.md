# Contributing
Please note that we have a code of conduct that must be followed at all times. 

## Issues
There are several kinds of issues open, including bug fixes, feature requests, and non-coding problems such as testing, screenshots, icon design, and app store descriptions. To claim an issue, comment on it and the maintainer will be in touch to discuss and assign the issue to you. Issues that have been assigned are only available for pull requests by the assignee, all other pull requests related to that issue will be rejected.  

## Pull Request Process
1. When contributing to this repository, first ensure that there is an issue open with the changes you wish to make. If not, open an issue, and discuss the change with the repository maintainer. Every PR must have an associated issue. 
2. Please refrain from submitting a pull request for issues that have not been assigned to you. This is to ensure that beginners have an equal chance to contribute, in the spirit of Hacktoberfest. Issues with the good-first-issue label will be reserved for developers who are new to Swift, OSS, or development in general. 
3. You may merge the pull request once it has been reviewed by a project maintainer. 

### Commit message conventions

We tend to use a Type:Description style for commit messages so it's easy to see what type of change is being made. Common types are:

- DOCS - Creating of new documents
- FIX - Bug fixes
- EDIT - Usually a follow up commit if a small error was spotted in a previous version
- REFACTOR
